# Synopsis:
# Run the test runner on a solution.

# Arguments:
# $1: exercise slug
# $2: absolute path to solution folder
# $3: absolute path to output directory

# Output:
# Writes the test results to a results.json file in the passed-in output directory.
# The test results are formatted according to the specifications at https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/main/building/tooling/test-runners/interface.md

# Example:
# ./bin/run.sh two-fer /absolute/path/to/two-fer/solution/folder/ /absolute/path/to/output/directory/

# If any required arguments is missing, print the usage and exit
if [ -z "$1" ] || [ -z "$2" ] || [ -z "$3" ]; then
    echo "usage: ./bin/run.sh exercise-slug /absolute/path/to/two-fer/solution/folder/ /absolute/path/to/output/directory/"
    exit 1

# Run the tests for the provided implementation file and redirect stdout and
# stderr to capture it
# TODO: Replace 'RUN_TESTS_COMMAND' with the command to run the tests

# Write the results.json file based on the exit code of the command that was 
# just executed that tested the implementation file

    # OPTIONAL: Sanitize the output
    # In some cases, the test output might be overly verbose, in which case stripping
    # the unneeded information can be very helpful to the student
    # sanitized_test_output=$(printf "${test_output}" | sed -n '/Test results:/,$p')

    # OPTIONAL: Manually add colors to the output to help scanning the output for errors
    # If the test output does not contain colors to help identify failing (or passing)
    # tests, it can be helpful to manually add colors to the output
