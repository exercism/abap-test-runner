# Exercism ABAP Test Runner

The Docker image to automatically run tests on ABAP solutions submitted to [Exercism].

## Run the test runner

To run the tests of an arbitrary exercise, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run.sh <exercise-slug> <solution-dir> <output-dir>`

Once the test runner has finished, its results will be written to `<output-dir>/results.json`.

## Run the test on one exercise

To test a single exercise, do the following:
1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-test-single-exercise.sh <exercise-slug> <exercise-slug> <output-dir>`

For example:  
`./bin/run-test-single-exercise.sh isogram ../abap/exercises/practice/isogram ./dist/output`

## Run the test on all exercises

To test all exercises, do the following:
1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-test-single-exercise.sh <exercise-slug> <exercise-slug> <output-dir>`

For example:
`./bin/run-test-exercises.sh ../abap/exercises/practice`

## Run the test runner on an exercise using Docker

_This script is provided for testing purposes, as it mimics how test runners run in Exercism's production environment._

To run the tests of an arbitrary exercise using the Docker image, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-in-docker.sh <exercise-slug> <solution-dir> <output-dir>`

Once the test runner has finished, its results will be written to `<output-dir>/results.json`.

## Run the tests

To run the tests to verify the behavior of the test runner, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in the project's root
2. Run `./bin/run-tests.sh`

These are [golden tests][golden] that compare the `results.json` generated by running the current state of the code against the "known good" `tests/<test-name>/results.json`. All files created during the test run itself are discarded.

When you've made modifications to the code that will result in a new "golden" state, you'll need to generate and commit a new `tests/<test-name>/results.json` file.
